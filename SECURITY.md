# Security Policy

## Security Updates

Security fixes are provided only for the latest release. Older releases are not maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for sensitive security reports.

Report sensitive vulnerabilities by contacting the project maintainer on X:

- X: https://x.com/tf_makimaki
- Repository: https://github.com/fuji-mak/Capsomnia
- Maintainer: https://github.com/fuji-mak

For non-sensitive bugs or documentation issues, opening a public GitHub issue is fine.

Please include:

- A short summary of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce.
- The macOS version.
- Whether the issue affects install, uninstall, sudoers, the privileged helper, or runtime behavior.

## Security Model

Capsomnia's menu bar app runs as the current user. It does not run as root.

Capsomnia does not collect telemetry or require an account. Its only network use is an optional daily update check that reads GitHub's public release information (off switch in Advanced Settings), plus downloading the installer from GitHub when you choose to update. Capsomnia sends no telemetry, identifiers, or personal data; the requests carry only standard network metadata.

When "Prevent all-caps typing" is disabled, Capsomnia does not request Input Monitoring or inspect keyboard events. When enabled, it requires Accessibility permission for a local active Core Graphics event filter. The filter removes only the Caps Lock modifier and suppresses the Caps Lock modifier-change event; it does not log, persist, or transmit event contents. If the filter is unavailable, Capsomnia turns sleep prevention off and reports an error instead of acting on the physical switch.

System sleep settings require elevated privileges, so Capsomnia installs a small root-owned native helper at:

```text
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/capsomnia-pmset
```

The sudoers rule only permits the current user to run:

```text
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/capsomnia-pmset on
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/capsomnia-pmset off
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/capsomnia-pmset display-sleep
```

The helper is a compiled executable. It does not invoke a shell or load shell startup files. It only accepts `on`, `off`, and `display-sleep`, and only executes `/usr/bin/pmset -a disablesleep` or `/usr/bin/pmset displaysleepnow`.

When an auto-off timer expires, Capsomnia first turns Caps Lock off through the existing HID path and confirms that `SleepDisabled=0`. Only then does the app invoke `/usr/bin/pmset sleepnow` directly as the signed-in user. This immediate sleep request does not use `sudo`, does not add a helper mode, and does not expand the sudoers rule. If Caps Lock cannot be turned off or the sleep-prevention state cannot be confirmed, Capsomnia does not request sleep.

Package installs keep `/Applications/Capsomnia.app`, the helper, and the system LaunchAgent owned by `root:wheel`. The packaged helper and app are signed with the same Developer ID. The app process still runs as the signed-in user. Capsomnia verifies the actual `SleepDisabled` state after each change and every ten seconds afterward. If the helper cannot apply a sleep-state change, the actual state cannot be verified, or the setting drifts, Capsomnia shows a red status indicator and retries instead of reporting the requested state as active.

The LaunchAgent restarts Capsomnia after crashes. If the app is force-killed while crash recovery is disabled or unavailable, the last system sleep setting can remain active. Users can restore normal behavior with `sudo pmset -a disablesleep 0`.
